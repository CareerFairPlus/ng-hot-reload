# ng-hot-reload-demo

This is a **demo** for [ng-hot-reload](https://github.com/noppa/ng-hot-reload) monorepo.  
It includes examples on how this package can be used for both Webpack and Gulp build setups.

What works for your build might look different, of course, but I hope these examples can help at least a bit.

The package also contains some e2e tests for the whole project (not for the example apps themselves). You only need to worry about those if you are contributing to the project.
